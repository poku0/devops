Modern webpages have many security checks in place, to avoid scraping, from Cloudflare or other services. Using requests library alone is not enough
To scrape better, we need to use BeautifulSoup, Selenium libraries, depending on the website pass User-agent header (e.g. headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
