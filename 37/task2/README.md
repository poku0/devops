# Task

## Select one of the logging tools discussed in this lesson (ELK Stack, Fluentd, Azure Log Analytics) and explore its features more deeply. Try setting it up and using it with a test application if possible. Write a brief report on its strenghts, weaknesses, and potential use cases. 

### Chosen ELK stack, cloning from https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk.git

```
Report:
Seems like a powerful stack, but complicated at first glance; steep learning curve. Need more time to explore it and a good usecase to adapt it to. 
```
